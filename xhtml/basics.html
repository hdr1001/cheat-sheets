   <h1>Document header (level 1)</h1>
   <h2>Document headers structure your page (level 2)</h2>
   <h3>Document headers can go six levels deep (level 3)</h3>

   <p>Perfectly ordinary paragraph</p>
   <p>Use <a href="http://www.google.com/" title="Jump to Google">this</a>
      hyperlink to jump to Google
   </p>
   <p>Make a <a href="#DestAnchor" title="Jump to destination anchor">jump</a>
      to the destination anchor defined in this document
   </p>

   <h3>More block level elements</h3>
   <p>This blockquote example contains the br element to force a new line.</p>
   <blockquote cite="http://www.shakespeare.com/"><p>
      To be, or not to be, <br />
      that is the question
   </p></blockquote>
   <p><acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
      lists are also block level elements.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>This is the first point I wanted to make.</li>
      <li>The second point is subdivided into two points;
         <ul>
            <li>The first, unordered, subpoint.</li>
            <li>The second, again unordered, subpoint.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There are two more points that I wanted to make. This is number
         three.</li>
      <li>Lastly point four.</li>
   </ol>

   <h3>Common inline elements</h3>
   <p>Most inline elements are very similar and have few attributes. The most
      commonly used inline elements are those used to markup phrases. Each of
      these elements has a different semantic meaning but they have the same
      syntax and characteristics.
   </p>
   <p>The <b>b</b> element suggests that the text be rendered as <b>bold</b>
      text. Probably an element such as <strong>strong</strong> is more
      appropriate since this element expresses the meaning of the markup more
      clearly. Another alternative for <b>bold</b> is <em>em</em> for 
      <em>emphasized</em>. More often however <em>em</em> is used as an 
      alternative for <i>i</i>. The <i>i</i> element stands for <i>italic</i>
      which is, of course, also an instruction primarily related to the
      rendering of text.

   <!-- Start of XHTML comment
      Please find listed below an example of a tabular data table
      Table tags missing from this example are;
         * colgroup is used most often in conjunction with the rules attribute
                    of the table tag to put borders between groups of columns.
         * col      defines the properties of one column except when used with
                    the span attibute. If the span attribute is set to a value
                    larger than one then the formating will apply to multiple
                    columns.
         * tfoot    indicates that a group of rows form the table footer.
      BTW table is a block level element!
